    "1. The `limited minimax search` and `limited alpha-beta search` will only considered `limited depth` of recursion (only considers a fixed number of moves ahead), instead of searching the game state until the terminal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `limited minimax search` and `limited alpha-beta search` will make decision based **estimation** of the non-terminal state utility, rather than evaluating the **real** terminal state utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The algorithm must alternate between maximizing and minimizing the utility at each level of the tree, as in the original minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a valid **heuristics** method implementation in `gobang` class to estimate **non-terminal** game board utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Heuristics are rules of thumb or shortcuts that are used to solve problems quickly and efficiently. They are often used when the optimal solution is too complex or too time-consuming to find. In the context of adversarial search, heuristics are used to estimate the utility of non-terminal game states. Heuristics can be based on domain-specific knowledge, such as the value of individual pieces in a chess game, or they can be based on general principles, such as the number of open lines in a game of Go. Heuristics are not guaranteed to provide an optimal solution, but they can be very effective in practice, especially when combined with other search techniques such as alpha-beta pruning.\n",

    "4. The **Agent** player, using `limited minimax search` or `limited alpha-beta search`, can play the game intelligently. => When play the `gobang` game against a human player, **Agent** will not lose the game within **20 steps**.\n",
