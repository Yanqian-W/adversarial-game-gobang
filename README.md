# Search techniques for Adversarial Game Gobang

- Develop rules for adversarial games
- Use adversrial search algorithms to solve the gobang game problem
  - `minimax algorithm`
  - `alpha-beta prunning`
  - Use `heuristics` to improve the efficiency
- Design and implement the heuristics to estimate the untility value of the non-terminal game board state of the gobang game, and evluating the posibility of a player winning the game
- Visualize the game board and achieve online gaming between AI and humans
